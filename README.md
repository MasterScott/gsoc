# Homebrew's Google Summer of Code
Homebrew is a package manager for macOS written in Ruby.

## Application Instructions

In your application tell us:

1. Who you are: your name and how we contact you (e.g. email)
2. What idea are you proposing: which of our ideas is it or describe in detail if it's your own
3. How will you implement it: provide a detailed work timeline that breaks the project into one or two week milestones
4. Why you: link to a previous Homebrew pull request you've submitted (this is a requirement to be accepted)

Homebrew is actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome applications from women from all backgrounds and people of colour.

### Google Summer of Code
Please read and apply via https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/.

## Mentors
- [@MikeMcQuaid](https://github.com/mikemcquaid) (mike@mikemcquaid.com)
- [@gauthamgoli](https://github.com/gauthamgoli) (goligautham@gmail.com)

Mentorship happens privately on our Homebrew maintainer's Slack and publicly on GitHub pull requests. Each student and project will be assigned a mentor but all students will work with all mentors.

Check out GitHub's blog post on how to run GSoC on GitHub for the standards expected from maintainers and students:

## Pass Requirements

- To be accepted one trivial pull request for your project to Homebrew will need to be merged (this can be far prior to the program)
- To pass the mid-term assessment one non-trivial pull request for your project to Homebrew will need to be merged
- To pass the final assessment more than one non-trivial pull request for your project to Homebrew will need to be reviewed and merged

## Technologies Used and Requirements

Homebrew is written mostly in Ruby (with small amounts of Bash), runs on Apple's macOS operating system and uses Git and GitHub for version control and updates. You do not need to have used any of these before but must have access to a Mac and be willing to learn Ruby, Git and GitHub.

## Ideas
These are suggestions that would make good Google Summer of Code projects. Feel free to open an issue if you wish to discuss or propose your own idea.

### Optimise formula and resource download ordering (https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/1666)
When `brew install`ing multiple formulae with multiple `resource`s the downloads do not happen all at the beginning but are interleaved through the `brew install` process (even with `resource`s within a single formula). This means if a single download fails mid-way through a lengthy build process the user may not notice and have to retry again later. This should be improved so the usability of Homebrew is improved. Similarly, this project could be extended to cover `caveats` and warnings for formulae being output all at the end of multiple `brew install`s for easy reference.

### Simplify bottling (binary package creation) for taps (third-party repositories) (https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/3346)
Using free resources on Azure Pipelines, Travis CI or Circle CI and `brew test-bot` it should be possible to create a documented, supported workflow for creating bottles for taps and have them be e.g. uploaded and published within the usual GitHub PR workflow (so only a "Merge pull request" is required by the tap maintainer). This would simplify the process of running a tap as tap maintainers would not need to support building from source (which is more error prone)

### Better support pinning to a major/minor version with Homebrew Bundle and `@`-versioned formulae
Users of Homebrew Bundle may wish to pin to a particular version of a package without knowing about versioned formulae. These formulae should be used automatically when possible. Inspiration can be taken from RubyGems, a `Brewfile.lock` file could be generated and formulae could be automatically copied into a tap where they could remain at the same version until they are manually updated in future.

### Improve integration with Homebrew Cask
Although Homebrew and Homebrew Cask have been merged the two projects are not fully integrated. For example, [`brew info` and `brew cask info` are separate commands](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/5456) that produce different output. Ideally all of Homebrew's commands that reference a formula would also be able to reference a cask and produce helpful output (although `brew install` and `brew cask install` should remain separate). This will make it easier for users to have casks recommended when there is not a formula (and vice-versa).

### Add license metadata to Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae (https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/5540)
Homebrew formulae do not have license metadata. For this to be included in Homebrew a `license` DSL would need to be added to Homebrew/brew and all relevant metadata would need to be added for Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae before they could be merged. Additionally, automated tests in `brew audit` should be added to verify this metadata matches what GitHub detects.

### Add Homebrew Cask to formulae.brew.sh (or similar) (https://github.com/Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh/issues/13)

The formulae.brew.sh website lists only Homebrew formulae. Using the same system (a Travis CI hook, a GitHub Pages site and JSON output) it should be possible to generate the same data for casks which can be displayed on a similar website.

### Improve usability of formulae.brew.sh

The formulae.brew.sh website is a static GitHub Pages site. Due to the underlying data being in JSON format it should be possible to add a [JavaScript search](https://github.com/Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh/issues/12), ways to query [the newest formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh/issues/29) and other usability improvements to better query the data.

### Automatically create pull requests based on [Homebrew/livecheck](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-livecheck)

Homebrew/livecheck provides various automated ways of detecting formulae updates. A separate application should be built to make use of these checks, verify that the results seem correct and open a pull request with relevant metadata on Homebrew/homebrew-core.

### Other Ideas
You can also get inspiration from [open `help wanted` issues on Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and [open `help wanted` issues on Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22). Please discuss any of these with us before submission to maximise your chances of being accepted.
